# Project Plan

## Title
Water Quality Analysis in Local Water Bodies accross U.S

## Main Question
What are the key factors influencing water quality in local water bodies, and how do they vary across different locations and seasons?

## Description
This project will analyze a dataset of water quality collected from various water bodies, focusing on factors such as turbidity, pH, dissolved oxygen, and temperature. By identifying trends, seasonal variations, and the impacts of location, this analysis will provide insights into the state of water quality, helping to inform environmental monitoring and conservation efforts.

## Datasources
### Datasource 1: The Home of the U.S. Government's Open Data
-**Metadata URL:** [Water Quality Dataset on Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/water-quality-data-41c5e)<br />
-**Data URL:** [Download CSV Dataset](https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/173741?Reference=117348)<br />
-**Data Type:** CSV<br />
This dataset includes water quality measures for various locations, providing information on key indicators like pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, and more.

### Datasource 2: Data from the National Aquatic Resource Surveys
-**Metadata URL:** https://www.epa.gov/system/files/other-files/2024-08/nla2022_condition_estimates_metadata_0.txt<br />
-**Data URL:** [[Download CSV Dataset](https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/173741?Reference=117348)](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/other-files/2024-08/nla22_condition_combined_2024-08-13_0.csv)<br />
-**Data Type:** CSV<br />
The National Lakes Assessment (NLA) 2022 dataset is a comprehensive resource containing data on various environmental and biological indicators for lakes across the U.S. It was designed to assess the health of these aquatic ecosystems and provides population estimates and confidence intervals for a variety of water quality metrics.
