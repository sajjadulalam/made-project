# Project Plan

## Title
Water Quality Analysis in Local Water Bodies

## Main Question
What are the key factors influencing water quality in local water bodies, and how do they vary across different locations and seasons?

## Description
This project will analyze a dataset of water quality collected from various water bodies, focusing on factors such as turbidity, pH, dissolved oxygen, and temperature. By identifying trends, seasonal variations, and the impacts of location, this analysis will provide insights into the state of water quality, helping to inform environmental monitoring and conservation efforts.
